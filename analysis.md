## Analysis Summary

For this homework I looked at two overarching patterns: the distribution of bike ride types across geographic location as well as how ride length correlaties to rider dedication, location, and time of day.

I noticed that most people choose to use classic bikes over electric across the board. However, riders who start at Sip Ave, Baldwin at Montgomery, Pershing Field, Bergen Ave, and Christ Hospital were more likely to choose an electric bike. Whether this is dependent on bike resources at these locations or due to the terrain around these locations is unclear and would require additional information about these regions to know.

As one might expect, members were more likely to have longer rides than casual bikers. There was a definite pattern to ride length depending on ride start time. Most rides occur in the evening, mostly starting at 5pm-7pm. However, for certain locations this pattern was reversed; at Brunswick & Sixth, most rides begin at 8am and dwingle as the day progresses. It would be interesting to see what about this location results in this pattern.
